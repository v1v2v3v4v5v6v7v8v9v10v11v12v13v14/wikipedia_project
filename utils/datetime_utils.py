        # Purpose: Extracts YYYY-MM-DD from various known pageview/pagecount filename formats using regex.
        # Logic: Tries multiple regex patterns, returns formatted string or None.
        # Dependencies: re, typing.
        # --- Refactoring Notes ---
        # - Pure utility function, doesn't use `self`.
        # - Specific to Wikimedia filename conventions.

        # --- Refactoring Notes ---
        # - Same as above - this just delegates.
        # - The imported `parse_timestamp` utility should be placed in the target structure (e.g., `utils/datetime_utils.py`).
        # - Components needing timestamp parsing (e.g., Parser) should call the utility directly.
        # --- Target Framework ---
        # - Delete this wrapper method. Call the `parse_timestamp` utility directly. Ensure utility is placed correctly.

def parse_timestamp(timestamp_str: Optional[str], context: str, logger: logging.Logger) -> Optional[datetime]:
    """ Parse an ISO 8601 timestamp string into a timezone-aware UTC datetime object. """
    # --- Analysis ---
    # Purpose: Converts MediaWiki's timestamp format (ISO 8601 with 'Z') to a Python timezone-aware datetime object (UTC).
    # Logic: Handles None input, replaces 'Z' with '+00:00' for `fromisoformat`, ensures tzinfo is set to UTC. Good error handling.
    # Dependencies: datetime, timezone, logging.
    # --- Refactoring Notes ---
    # - GOOD UTILITY: Robust parsing for the specific timestamp format used.
    # - Context argument is good for informative logging.
    # --- Target Framework ---
    # - Move this function to `utils/datetime_utils.py`.
    # ... (Code logic is good) ...
