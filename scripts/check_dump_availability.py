        """ Check availability of Wikipedia pageview dumps. """
        # --- Analysis ---
        # Purpose: Connects to Wikimedia dump site, scrapes index pages for multiple years/months,
        #          and reports which pageview files (by type) are available.
        # Logic: Nested loops, HTTP requests, regex parsing of HTML index pages. Builds a results dictionary.
        # Dependencies: datetime, requests, re. (Implicitly uses self.session via requests if available, but doesn't explicitly call it).
        # --- Refactoring Notes ---
        # - This is a utility/discovery function, not core processing logic. It doesn't belong in the main processor.
        # - It's useful for planning downloads but separate from executing them.
        # - Could potentially reuse `_get_available_dates` logic or similar patterns.
        # - Regex parsing of HTML is fragile.
        # --- Target Framework ---
        # - Move this entire method into a separate script or utility module focused on checking
        #   Wikimedia dump availability (e.g., `scripts/check_dump_availability.py` or `utils/wikimedia_checker.py`).
        # ... (Code as provided) ...

    def download_pageviews_from_test(self, test_results: Dict, output_dir: str = "./downloads/pageviews", verbose: bool = True) -> Dict:
        """ Download pageview files based on test results. """
        # --- Analysis ---
        # Purpose: Takes the output from `test_pageviews_dump` and downloads the files listed as available.
        # Logic: Iterates through the nested results dictionary, constructs URLs, calls `download_pageview_dump`.
        # Dependencies: os, self.download_pageview_dump (to be replaced).
        # --- Refactoring Notes ---
        # - This acts as an orchestrator specifically for downloading based on the test results.
        # - It should live alongside `test_pageviews_dump` as it consumes its output directly.
        # - Needs to be refactored to call the external `download_file` utility instead of the internal one.
        # - Directory creation logic is fine.
        # --- Target Framework ---
        # - Move this method together with `test_pageviews_dump` into the separate script/module
        #   (e.g., `scripts/check_dump_availability.py` could have both test and download-from-test functions).
        # - Update the internal download call.
        # ... (Code structure okay, needs internal call updated) ...
