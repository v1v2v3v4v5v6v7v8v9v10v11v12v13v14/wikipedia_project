def main(file_location: str):
    """Main function to process a Wikipedia dump file"""
    # --- Analysis ---
    # Purpose: Orchestrates the reading of a BZ2 file, parsing, batching, and storing.
    # Logic: Opens file, iterates through parsed items, batches, calls bulk store. Basic timing stats.
    # Dependencies: bz2, datetime, WikipediaProcessor (Parser), WikipediaDocumentStore.
    # --- Refactoring Notes ---
    # - Orchestration Logic: The core loop (iterating, batching, triggering storage) belongs in the
    #   new Orchestrator class. It should receive parsed data *from* the StreamParser.
    # - Parser/Store Instantiation: These should not be instantiated here. The Orchestrator should receive
    #   dependencies (like the persistence service) via injection. The StreamParser might be instantiated
    #   by the orchestrator or also injected.
    # - Interaction: The call `parser.parse_xml(file)` needs to change. The Orchestrator will likely
    #   call a method on the StreamParser, passing the file stream. The StreamParser will yield parsed items.
    #   The call `store.bulk_process_and_store(current_batch)` needs to change to call the appropriate
    #   method on the injected persistence service, passing the batch of *processed* documents.
    # - Batching: Batching logic can remain within the Orchestrator.
    # - Stats: Stat tracking is good, can remain within the Orchestrator.
    # --- Target Framework ---
    # - Move the loop, batching, and calls to parsing/storage into processing/orchestrator.py (Orchestrator class).
    # - The file opening (`bz2.open`) might happen in the entry point script or be passed to the Orchestrator.
    # - Replace direct parser/store calls with calls to injected dependencies / internal components.

    # --- Example structure in Orchestrator.run_job(filepath) ---
    # self.persistence_service = ... # Injected
    # self.stream_parser = StreamParser(...) # Instantiated or Injected
    # stats = {...}
    # current_batch = []
    # batch_size = 100
    # with bz2.open(filepath, 'rt') as file:
    #     for processed_document_object in self.stream_parser.parse(file): # Parser yields objects/dicts
    #           current_batch.append(processed_document_object)
    #           if len(current_batch) >= batch_size:
    #               batch_stats = self.persistence_service.save_documents_and_revisions_bulk(current_batch)
    #               # update overall stats from batch_stats

        # --- Refactoring Notes ---

        # - This is pure orchestration logic, connecting the parsing/batching stage with the storage stage.
