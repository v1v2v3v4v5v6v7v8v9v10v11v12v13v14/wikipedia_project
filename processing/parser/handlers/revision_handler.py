    def handle_processing_error(self, error: Exception, stats: dict) -> dict:
        # --- Analysis ---
        # Purpose: Wrapper around an imported `handle_error` utility function.
        # Logic: Simply calls the imported function.
        # Dependencies: handle_error (imported utility), self.logger, self.debug.
        # --- Refactoring Notes ---
        # - This method just delegates. The real logic is in the imported `handle_error`.
        # - The imported `handle_error` should be placed in the target structure (e.g., `utils/error_handling.py`).
        # - Classes that need error handling (like Orchestrator) can either call the utility directly or have their own helper method that calls it. This wrapper method is likely redundant after refactoring.
        # --- Target Framework ---
        # - Delete this wrapper method. Call the `handle_error` utility directly from where it's needed (e.g., Orchestrator). Ensure the utility function is placed correctly (e.g., `utils/error_handling.py`).
        return handle_error(error, stats, self.logger, self.debug)
